### What I learned

Through hands-on experience with a project, I've gained a solid understanding of fundamental CSS techniques for webpage sectioning. Experimenting with the `display` property taught me how to manipulate element layouts, whether as block-level entities, inline elements, or inline-block containers. Additionally, mastering CSS `positioning` allowed me to precisely position sections within the webpage layout, offering versatility in design. Understanding the CSS `box model` enabled me to effectively structure content areas with control over padding, border, and margin properties. Furthermore, exploring `advanced layout models such as Flexbox and Grid` empowered me to create intricate and responsive sectioning structures, enhancing the overall user experience. This practical project-based learning journey has deepened my proficiency in CSS sectioning techniques, equipping me with valuable skills for future web development endeavors.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
